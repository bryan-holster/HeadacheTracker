Development
-----------

Fork the repository. Then, to work with it locally:

Clone your repository

    git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/HeadacheTracker.git
    
`cd` into the folder created, and use virtualenv to create an isolated python environment

    virtualenv venv
    
(`venv` is the suggested foldername, as it is excluded in the `.gitignore`)

Activate the virtual environment

    source venv/bin/activate
    
Then install project dependencies using

    pip install -r requirements.txt
